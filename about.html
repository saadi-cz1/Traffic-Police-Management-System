          <h2>About City Traffic Police Bannu</h2>
          <p>
            City Traffic Police Peshawar is one of the five police jurisdictions
            in the capital city and is responsible for managing and controlling
            traffic matters of a huge area of 1257 square kilometers. The
            Traffic force, established in 1971, comprising of 500 police
            officers and personnel, controls the road traffic, which has lately
            become a major task for the police. Due to the increase in volume of
            road traffic, causing continuous traffic congestion in the cities
            especially in peak hours, the demands on the police to meet with the
            situation for smooth running of traffic has a corresponding
            increase.

          <h3>History</h3>
          <p>
            The concept of the traffic Police in Peshawar was introduced in 1971
            under the command and control of a Senior Superintendent of Police
            and ever since the department has been rendering effective services
            towards building a community where traffic crimes are minimal and
            every violation is being dealt strictly according to the laws. In
            1984, another milestone was achieved in the shape of traffic school
            establishment. The main objective of the school is to train the
            police constables and other staff and turn them into a good law
            enforcing force. The traffic cadre was also introduced the same year
            with the purpose to bring the traffic police under the command and
            control of AIG Traffic. The new position was created in order to
            make effective policies and prepare vigilant and efficient force.
            Besides, the introduction of ticketing system in 1998 is also a
            remarkable step toward achieving a controlled-traffic society. In
            2003 the division of AIG and SSP contributed to the developmental
            task and multiplied its competence. Four years later in 2007; the
            generation of new codes consolidated traffic police department, and
            in 2009 e-payment system was introduced to squeeze the worries of
            general public.
